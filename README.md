# React Test Task

## Requirements

We need you to implement a solution to display price tickers data on the UI in realtime.

Price data is available from a locally running service (see information below). Any additional visualisations to indicate how prices have changed would be a plus. Testing is also an important part to this exercise.

Requirements:

- application should connect to the locally running service
- application should render price changes for some tickers in real time

You can get some ideas how your application may look like on the [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/) page.

As a bonus you can implement (please describe implemented bonus functionality in this file):

- any additional visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices
- the possibility to switch on/off tickers by user
- the possibility to specify interval time by user
- the possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group
- any additional functionality you consider useful

You should use the next technologies:

- React (preferable with hooks)
- Redux (with Redux-Thunk or any other Redux middleware you are familiar) or any other state-manager library you want
- Socket.io - to connect to the service
- any UI library you want, or you can use just pure CSS
- Testing Library

We will assess the next parts:

- workability: how your application works
- projects structure: how you structure your files
- code quality: how you write clean, readable code (feel free to install and use ESLint and Prettier)
- knowledge React and its ecosystem: how you compose and use libraries together
- testing: how you can test your code

## Running the local service

1. Open a new bash shell
2. `cd server`
3. `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. `npm run start` or `yarn start`
5. You can visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to check that the service is working correctly and inspect the data it produces.

## Run your application

1. Open a new bash shell
2. `cd client`
3. `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. `npm run start` or `yarn start`

## Run the tests

1. Open a new bash shell
2. `cd client`
3. `npm run test` or `yarn test`

# Price Service Usage

URL:
`http://localhost:4000`

Price tickers are real-time via web-sockets.
