# React Test Task

## Requirements

We need you to implement a solution to display price tickers data on the UI in realtime.

Price data is available from a locally running service (see information below). Any additional visualisations to indicate how prices have changed would be a plus. Testing is also an important part to this exercise.

Requirements:
- application should connect to the locally running service
- application should render price changes for some tickers in real time

You can get some ideas how your application may look like on the [Google Finance](https://www.google.com/finance/) page.

As a bonus you can implement (please describe implemented bonus functionality in this file):
- any additional visual effects to highlight positive or negative changes in the prices
- the possibility to switch on/off tickers by user
- the possibility to specify interval time by user
- the possibility to add/remove ticker from watching group
- any additional functionality you consider useful

You should use the next technologies:
- React (preferable with hooks)
- Redux (with Redux-Thunk or any other Redux middleware you are familiar) or any other state-manager library you want
- Socket.io - to connect to the service
- any UI library you want, or you can use just pure CSS
- Testing Library

We will assess the next parts:
- workability: how your application works
- projects structure: how you structure your files
- code quality: how you write clean, readable code (feel free to install and use ESLint and Prettier)
- knowledge React and its ecosystem: how you compose and use libraries together
- testing: how you can test your code

## Running the local service
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd server```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```
5. You can visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to check that the service is working correctly and inspect the data it produces.

## Run your application
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd client```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```

## Run the tests
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd client```
3. ```npm run test``` or ```yarn test```

# Price Service Usage

URL:
```http://localhost:4000```

Price tickers are real-time via web-sockets.

## Example JSON Response from the Price Ticker service
```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "exchange": "NASDAQ",
    "price": 279.29,
    "change": 64.52,
    "change_percent": 0.84,
    "dividend": 0.56,
    "yield": 1.34,
    "last_trade_time": "2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"
  },
  {"ticker":"GOOGL","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":237.08,"change":154.38,"change_percent":0.10,"dividend":0.46,"yield":1.18,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"MSFT","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":261.46,"change":161.45,"change_percent":0.41,"dividend":0.18,"yield":0.98,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"AMZN","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":260.34,"change":128.71,"change_percent":0.60,"dividend":0.07,"yield":0.42,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"FB","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":266.77,"change":171.92,"change_percent":0.75,"dividend":0.52,"yield":1.31,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"},
  {"ticker":"TSLA","exchange":"NASDAQ","price":272.13,"change":158.76,"change_percent":0.10,"dividend":0.96,"yield":1.00,"last_trade_time":"2021-04-30T11:53:21.000Z"}
]
```
